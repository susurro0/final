                        Jody Klaire lives in South Wales with Fergus, her golden retriever. 
                        She is an award winning, best-selling author of many books, from her 
                        award-winning mystery/action adventure series The Above & Beyond Series 
                    to her Best-selling and award winning romances. Jody has many more short 
                    stories in anthologies which raise money for great causes.

                    When Jody isn’t writing, mentoring, teaching creative writing, or talking 
                    about writing, she is partial to a spot of cake.

                    As Aeron would say, ‘to cut a novel to a nugget,’ I’m an author. I write thrillers, action adventures, a little romance, a lot of humour, and sometimes I write short stories too. I blog here on my website and I also guestblog.
                </p>

                <h3>
                    What Started My Journey
                </h3>
                <p>
                    I was in the music industry for 17 years, while also managing to be a 
                    police officer and numerous other “proper jobs.” I became very unwell 
                    in my late twenties and needed full-time care. Writing started off as 
                    something to do while I stared up at my bedroom ceiling but then became 
                    a friend and a passion.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I had written many books before I turned thirty but penned The Empath 
                    just before that birthday. It became my debut novel. I have always had Aeron’s 
                    series planned out in my head from when I started. Currently (in January) 
                    there are six books of the seven published with Full Circle to follow.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am not just about fast-action-packed thrillers either. I also write 
                    romances, mainly romcoms and some romantic intrigue. Currently there 
                    are four novels: La Vie En Bleu; Best Maid Plans, Beached & In Fashion; 
                    and two short stories/anthologies: If The Shoe Fits & Love’s Bridge. 
                </p>

                <h3>
                    My Writing Style
                </h3>
                <p> My writing style is designed to be re-readable. I try to create vivid 
                    stories and characters that you can revisit over and over again. I use 
                    close up Narrative Distance often in my work which means you often experience 
                    the story as the character. When it comes to thrillers – especially 
                    The Above & Beyond Series, I love to create complex stories with oodles
                    of subplot. When it comes to romance, I aim to make you smile, laugh and 
                    enjoy falling in love… but that doesn’t mean I skimp on subplot.
                </p>

                <h3>About Me Personally </h3>
                <p>
                    I love making people smile. Whatever I do in my work, that’s the feeling I want to give you when you pick up my books. I want to uplift you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Away from writing, I’ve played a lot of different sports; some well, some… well… I wouldn’t win awards for but I always loved running around and putting my heart into it. Now, I love watching the NSWL (in particular Orlando and Seattle;) watching Wales women dazzle on the football pitch, watching or playing wheelchair tennis. Being Welsh, rugby is also ingrained in my heart!
                </p>
                <p>
                    
                    I love all creative things from painting to digital concept art, playing or singing and generally attempting to make anyone within shouting distance laugh.
                </p>
                <p>
                    
                    Fergus is my trusty (and famous) assistance dog. That means he helps me take off my shoes etc. He also has his own special talent when he’s bossing me around and he might just be the cutest dog ever. (I may be biased but I have supporters.)  Fergus has been trained using positive reinforcement, and off-duty, he loves to pull “zoomies” at will, dig up the garden, has a big sense of humour and enjoys cuddles.
